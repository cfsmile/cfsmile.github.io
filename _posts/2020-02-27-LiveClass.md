## Tax type: VAT and GST
VAT (Value added tax) is an indirect tax levied at each stage of manufacture and distribution of goods on the incremental value. VAT is notoriously causing the cascading effect, or double taxation.

GST (Goods and service tax)  is a tax on value addition, imposed on the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services.

The true VAT can take place only when all goods and services are taxed at the same rate.  GST is another name of VAT but it taxes both goods and services at the same rates. It eliminates many disputes which arises due to taxing goods and services seperately.  GST is expected to eliminate all such disputes because all transactions shall be taxed at the same rate and no distinction is made between goods and services.

The primary difference between VAT and GST is that while VAT applies to the sale of goods, GST applies to the supply of goods and services.

## Tax Nexus

Nexus in general means a connection. The term nexus is used in tax law to describe a situation in which a business has a "nexus" or tax presence in a particular state or states. A nexus is basically a connection between a taxing jurisdiction, like a state, and an entity like a business that must collect or pay the tax.

Sales tax nexus defines the level of connection between a taxing jurisdiction such as a state and an entity such as your business.

Until this connection is established, the taxing jurisdiction cannot impose its sales taxes on you.

## fact
the origin of tax nexus is two clauses of the U.S. Constitution, the due process clause, which requires a connection, and the commerce clause, which "requires substantial presence".


## analysis
A nexus for state sales tax purposes has, in the past, required a *physical presence* of the taxing business in that state. In the past 10 to 15 years, a growing concern has driven states to more closely consider *online businesses and non-payment of sales taxes*. The states feel that online businesses are not collecting sales taxes from online sales, and the states feel these revenues should go to them.


## method
On 21st June 2018, the United States’ Supreme Court passed its judgment in favor of the state in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. The decision *overruled a longstanding physical presence rule*. It allows states have the right to require online sellers to charge and collect sales tax from all online buyers, not just buyers physically located in that state.  

In South Dakota v. Wayfair, the Court eliminated the physical presence rule within the Commerce Clause as the standard for creating nexus in a jurisdiction. However, physical presence will still create nexus and is the first consideration in determining nexus.


## conclusion
Sales tax nexus can be understood in a broader sense. Broadly, it’s the tax that occurs when a business has any transactional connection to one of the states.

While every state has a different definition of sales tax nexus, generally an ‘economic connection’ (generating a number of sales in one state; it could be either a certain or fixed number of transactions or a certain dollar amount) or ‘physical presence’ is believed to create sales tax nexus.
